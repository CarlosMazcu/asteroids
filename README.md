# Asteroids Game

## How to Run
Simply execute `Asteroids.exe` to start the game.

There is no need to compile the code, as the source code is provided for you to browse, but it cannot be recompiled.

## Account Management
To play the game, you need to create an account. You can manage accounts through a special user called `admin`, with the password `a123456`. 

Users earn credits in two ways:
1. By creating an account.
2. By entering the top 10 leaderboard.

The admin user has the ability to edit both the credits and the data of all users.

## Game Modes
There are several game modes available:
- 1 Player
- 2 Player
- Hardcore 1 Player
- Hardcore 2 Player

## LogIn Screen
On the LogIn screen, if you press the `Shift` key, the system will auto-complete with an existing user who has enough credits.
