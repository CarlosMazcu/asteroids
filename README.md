## About
This is a recreation of the original *Asteroids* game by Atari, released in 1979. It captures the essence of the classic arcade game while adding some modern features for account management and multiplayer modes.

## How to Run
Simply execute `Asteroids.exe` to start the game.

There is no need to compile the code, as the source code is provided for you to browse, but it cannot be recompiled.

The admin user has the ability to edit both the credits and the data of all users.
